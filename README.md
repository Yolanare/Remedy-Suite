# Project
<strong>Remedy</strong> is a project to improve the user experience of a service with a simple CSS injection (and maybe JS in the future as well).

The goal is to do something that respects the visual identity of these services, while making sure that the CSS can sustain any eventual interface changes and continue working *like it ain't nothin'*.

With CSS, there are many ways of doing this, especially with attribute selectors <i>(The day I knew this existed just turned my world upside down)</i>.

## I'll call the thing the "Remedy Suite". *Sounds cool nah?*<br>
On this git, you have access to all the remedies separated in folders. Once you've downloaded one, you wont need to download it a new time to update it, they will automatically be since i'll link them to the world wide web.<br>
*For the moment I'm using some temporary links, so if it doesn't work re-download it or let me know.*

# My plans
I'll start working on Discord, next after widely finishing it I'll do Twitter <i>(I really hate how they made their interface, I'll put back the centered timeline)</i>. For the third one i thought about YouTube, why not. I'll see in the future for more services, i don't need to plan everything since i don't even know if I'll be able to handle these three alone.

# How
I may in the future create an extension for browser to inject the CSS in the websites, but for the moment since I'm not focusing on that, I'll recommand some that do the job perfectly.
* To inject CSS on a website: [Live editor for CSS, Less & Sass](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor)<br>
*Don't forget to click on the pin icon at the top right so it loads automatically at every start of the page*<br>
* For Discord desktop app: [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/)<br>
*Put the file in the theme folder, go to "Settings" > "Themes" > "Open Theme folder" at the top*

## Follow the progress of each remedy
I made a Google Sheet so I can stay organized, for you to check if something weird you found is broken or that has not been enhanced yet, and to see the progress of an idea you submitted.<br>
You can access it by clicking on [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LR8RfaxjRO9Ev-tWh12wy1si0-57OXMxzTpdTz63WPo/edit?usp=sharing).<br>
*Every remedy is on a different sheet (look at the bottom of the page).*
