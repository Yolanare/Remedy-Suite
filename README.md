# Project
<strong>Remedy</strong> is a project to improve the user experience of a service with a simple CSS injection *(and maybe JS in the future as well)*.<br>
The goal is to do something to *remedy* the weaknesses of these services by making them more lively and pleasant to use while respecting their visual identity. The main difficulty is to ensure that the CSS can sustain any eventual User Interface (UI) changes and continue working *like it ain't nothin'*.

With CSS, there are many ways of doing this, especially with attribute selectors <i>(the day I knew these existed just turned my world upside down)</i>.

## I'll call the thing "Remedy Suite". *Sounds cool nah?*
On this git, you have access to all the remedies separated in folders. Once you've downloaded one, you wont need to download it a new time to update it, they will automatically be since i'll link them to the world wide web.<br>
<br>

# My plans
I'll start working on Discord, next after widely finishing it I'll do Twitter <i>(I really hate how they made their interface, I'll put back the centered timeline)</i>. For the third one i thought about YouTube, why not. I'll see in the future for more services, I don't need to plan everything from the beginning since I don't even know if I'll be able to handle these three alone.

## Little Disclaimer
### Rights
I am not the creator of the services supported in the Remedy Suite. All I wish to do is to improve the experience of all users using them and I do not wish in any way to appropriate the rights to these services. This is actually one of the reasons why Remedy **is** and **will remain free**. *And I'm working on it in my free time btw.*

### Performances
As I work on the remedies, I'm just going to assume that the people who are looking for this kind of strange customization are not complete computer newbies, and therefore don't have a toaster as a computer. Which means that I don't take small PCs that much into account. I'm not saying that I skip optimization and performances, but I can't really do much for that. These services on their own are already **optimized** for all computers, no matter how low-powered they may be *(normally)*. And that's precisely why in some cases it may look quite cheap, but it's in fact sacrifices that the designers had to make because some of you are wandering around on the web with toasters. *I'm doing the opposite so obviously it's probably not as easy on your toaster.*

*And so this is mainly the reason why I want to remain faithful to the original UI, to push it to its peak.*<br>
*When developing them, I put myself inside the shoes of the real guy who made the interface (and if there are more than one designer I have schizophrenia), and I try my best to adapt what I do according to the user's needs and the aesthetic of the UI.*<br>
<br>

# How
I may in the future create an extension for browser to inject the CSS in the websites, but for the moment since I'm not focusing on that, I'll recommand some that do the job perfectly.
* **To inject CSS on a website: [Live editor for CSS, Less & Sass](https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor)**<br>
*You need to **be on the page of the service** you want to use Remedy on, **open the extention** (black arrow at the top right of the browser usually) and then **paste in the "@import url(...)"** that you can find in the folder of the Remedy you want*<br>
*Don't forget to click on the pin icon at the top right of the little blue window so it loads automatically at every start of the page*<br>
* **For Discord desktop app: [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/)**<br>
*Put the file in the theme folder, go to "Settings" > "Themes" > "Open Theme folder" at the top*
<br>

## Follow the progress of each remedy
I've made a Google Sheet so I can stay organized, for you to check if something weird you found is broken or that has not been enhanced yet, and to see the progress of an idea you submitted.<br>
**You can access it by clicking on** [**this link**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LR8RfaxjRO9Ev-tWh12wy1si0-57OXMxzTpdTz63WPo/edit?usp=sharing)**.**<br>
*Every remedy is on a different sheet (look at the bottom of the page).*
