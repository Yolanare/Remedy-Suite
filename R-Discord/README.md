# How
* You need to install [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) to use this theme (at least that's what I use).<br>
*This app can do much more than CSS injections, I recommand you to look at what else it can do.*
* Next, save [DiscordRemedy.theme.css](https://github.com/Yolanare/Remedy-Suite/blob/master/R-Discord/DiscordRemedy.theme.css).<br>
*You need to **[Right Click]** on the "Raw" button, and select **[Save Link As...]**.*
* Put this file in the theme folder of BetterDiscord.<br>
*Open Discord, go to "Settings" > "Themes" > "Open Theme folder" at the top.*
